# swagaf
SWAG dataset. More info is at [rowanzellers.com/swag](https://rowanzellers.com/swag).

## Setting up your environment
To create an environment you will need to intall Python 3.6, PyTorch 3.1, and AllenNLP.  Additional
requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`.

You will also need to set PYTHONPATH to the `swagaf` directory.  You can do this by running the
following command from the `swagaf` folder.

```
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
```

Alternatively, you can build and run the included Dockerfile to create an environment.

```
docker build -t swagaf .
docker run -it swagaf
```

## Common use cases
There is additional documentation in the subfolders.

* `data/` contains the SWAG dataset.
* `swag_baslines/` contains baseline implementations and instructions for how to run them.

Most people will not need to look at `create_swag` or `raw_data` but it's there if you need it!
